# TTS-PTCG-scripted-board
A scripted board for Pokemon TCG for use in Tabletop Simulator, to be placed in a properly sized tile.

The boards have simple but effective scripts and snap points, that allow you to easily fill your bench and switch pokemon with your active using new switch buttons, as well as buttons for automatically playing your prizes and cutting any number of cards from the top of your deck. Additionally every single board art in RoymyKing's mod has been integrated into the mod, and the arts can easily be switch between using the buttons and textbox in the top left of the board. 

The latter 2 functions can be controlled using either + or - buttons near the object or by clicking the number's text box directly and typing a new number in. By using my own system I avoid using a bloated state system, making the boards lean and easy to run. The scripts are not at all tied to the game either, and can be easily copied into whatever room you are playing and placed in any orientation and still work perfectly.
